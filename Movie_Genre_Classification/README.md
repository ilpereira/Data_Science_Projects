# Plot-based movie genre classification using Machine Learning

This project consists in classifying movies in terms of genre by analyzing their plots using NLP techniques and Machine Learning.
Two types of classification tasks were performed: multiclass and binary. Further details can be found in the header of the notebook file.

This directory contains the following files:
- text_classification_movie_genres.ipynb -> the notebook which contains all the performed experiments for movie genre classification along with corresponding descriptions and analyses;
- df_preprocessed_binary.csv -> the dataframe used for binary classification
- df_preprocessed_multi.csv -> the dataframe used for multiclass classification

You can find the final models in the following directory: https://bit.ly/2YyZDCa

The multiclass classification models are:
- bow_best_model.zip
- lstm_best_model.zip
- cnn_best_model.zip

The binary classification models are:
- bow_best_model_binary.zip
- lstm_best_model_binary.zip
- cnn_best_model_binary.zip
